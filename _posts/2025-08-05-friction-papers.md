I'm excited to share that two of my research papers on **friction** have been published this past week. Both works are tied to my PhD thesis, and I‚Äôm very pleased with how they turned out.

### 1. Velocity-Dependent Friction and Wear  
The first article, *‚ÄúVelocity-Dependent Dynamics of Friction and Wear,‚Äù* explores how sliding velocity influences friction and wear using molecular dynamics simulations.  
We identified **three distinct velocity regimes**, with a surprising local minimum in both friction and wear.  
One key implication: **adjusting velocity could reduce both friction and wear** ‚Äî an insight with potential relevance for everything from nanoscale devices to industrial machinery.

*Inverse frictional design.*

### 2. AI-Driven Surface Design for Friction Control  
The second paper is more of a **proof-of-concept**. Here, we demonstrate how surfaces can be designed to achieve **target friction properties** using an automated, iteration-free method.  
Inspired by **generative AI and image synthesis**, we trained a **conditional diffusion model** that maps static friction coefficients to corresponding surface structures.  

This opens a door to **inverse design in tribology**, where we specify the desired outcome and let the model generate the right solution.
