## Purpose of the Website

Today, substantial information about me (and individuals in general) is often dispersed across social media platforms, professional websites, and scientific publications. This website aims to consolidate the most crucial information about me and my work into a single, accessible location. To reach a wider audience, I plan to present popular scientific summaries of my research and publications. The website is structured into two main sections. The *Posts* section will feature discussions on new findings, intriguing ideas, and various topics of interest. The *Projects* section will serve as an evolving portfolio, highlighting the projects I am currently involved in or have participated in previously.

## Why is it Launched Now?

It is often suggested that a personal website should be established as early as possible. While I could have created this site earlier, the present moment is especially opportune as I am transitioning from my PhD position to a new position at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway). This period is filled with exciting developments that I am eager to share. By the end of this year, I anticipate submitting five papers: two on friction related to my PhD, two in collaboration with colleagues at MET Norway and the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF), and one on molecular dynamics simulations of dissociative water. Additionally, I will attend several conferences in the coming months.

I look forward to an exciting autumn. Stay tuned for more updates.
