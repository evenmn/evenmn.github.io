Catchy intro paragraph about Bris and its significance in weather forecasting.

Mention stretched grid post, and also the WeatherGenerator post. Also mention Bris paper

# Conclusions

WeatherGenerator aims to build the next generation of weather‑forecasting models. This is crucial for warning against increasingly frequent extreme weather events and for maintaining Europe’s position as a world leader in global weather prediction. Given Europe’s unparalleled meteorological datasets and HPC resources, there is good reason to believe we can achieve this.

For more information, see the official ECMWF blog post.
