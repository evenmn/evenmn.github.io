Can we replicate recent advances in data-driven weather forecasting at high spatial resolution?

In recent years, data-driven weather models have demonstrated impressive predictive skill at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. However, most of these models are trained on ERA5 reanalysis data at a relatively coarse horizontal resolution of about 31 km. This raises an important question: can we achieve similar performance in a high-resolution setting that captures finer-scale weather phenomena?

We present Bris, a high-resolution probabilistic data-driven weather model trained on the MetCoOp Ensemble Prediction System (MEPS) analysis at 2.5 km resolution. The name "Bris" means *breeze* in Norwegian and is pronounced similarly—no abbreviation or acronym. This work is a collaboration between the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF).

To produce physically realistic weather scenarios, we developed a novel training objective that combines physical and spectral probabilistic criteria. The resulting model matches the forecast skill of MEPS while running 20 to 30 times faster. In this post, we explore the key ideas behind Bris’s design, training, and performance, as well as the path forward.

I aim to explain the concepts in clear, accessible language. For a more technical treatment, see [our recent preprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23043v). The methodology builds on the stretched-grid approach discussed in [an earlier post](https://evennordhagen.com/2024-09-12-stretched-grid/).

## The case for high resolution

Why invest effort in high-resolution models? Aren’t current state-of-the-art models at coarser resolutions sufficient?

The answer depends on the weather variable and the application. Some phenomena, like rain showers and local wind gusts, vary significantly over small distances. Capturing this variability requires high spatial resolution. This is why many national meteorological and hydrological services (NMHSes) develop and operate high-resolution models.

Conversely, other variables, such as mean sea level pressure, primarily reflect large-scale atmospheric patterns. For these, increasing resolution yields little improvement. To illustrate this, we compare Bris (2.5 km resolution) with ECMWF’s data-driven model AIFS-CRPS at 31 km {% cite lang2024a %}:

*Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) for 2m temperature, 10m wind speed, 6-hour accumulated precipitation, and mean sea level pressure. Bris (high resolution) is compared to AIFS-CRPS (lower resolution) against synoptic stations in Norway. Lower scores indicate better performance.*

CRPS is a proper scoring rule for probabilistic forecasts; think of it as a measure of prediction accuracy that accounts for uncertainty. Bris shows clear improvements in temperature, wind speed, and precipitation forecasts but performs slightly worse on mean sea level pressure. Since AIFS-CRPS is a state-of-the-art global data-driven model, this comparison highlights the value of high resolution for certain variables.

High resolution is especially important for predicting extreme weather events like heavy precipitation and storms, which threaten millions in Europe annually. Given that saving lives and property is a core NMHS responsibility, high-resolution probabilistic models are essential.

*The Lorenz system illustrates atmospheric chaos and sensitivity to initial conditions. Here, two nearly identical initial states (blue trajectory perturbed by 10^-8 in x-direction relative to orange) diverge rapidly. This sensitivity is known as the butterfly effect.*

## Why probabilistic forecasting?

Weather prediction models can be deterministic—producing a single forecast—or probabilistic, which estimate the likelihood of multiple possible outcomes.

The atmosphere is a chaotic system influenced by inherently unpredictable stochastic processes such as turbulence. In chaos theory terms, the atmosphere is a level 1 chaotic system, meaning its future state is governed by random processes beyond our control. For comparison, the stock market is often considered a level 2 chaotic system, where our current actions influence future dynamics.

Even if the atmosphere were entirely deterministic, measurement errors and incomplete knowledge of initial conditions create uncertainty. Edward Lorenz famously demonstrated this with a set of nonlinear differential equations showing that tiny changes in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes—the butterfly effect (see animation above). This sensitivity limits the predictability horizon of weather forecasts.

Because of these factors, forecasting probabilities rather than single outcomes better reflects the true uncertainty. Probabilistic forecasts provide three key benefits:

1. Quantification of uncertainty
2. Sharp, physically consistent fields
3. Ability to capture rare extreme events

Probabilistic forecasts are often implemented as ensemble prediction systems (EPS), which generate multiple realizations to represent possible future states. Think of ensemble members as trajectories like the blue and orange lines in the Lorenz system animation. Each member is considered equally likely, and probabilities are derived by clustering the ensemble.

Deterministic models typically minimize mean squared error, producing forecasts that approximate the average of all possible outcomes. However, this often leads to unrealistic, overly smooth forecasts that do not correspond to any physically plausible scenario—a problem known as the double penalty effect.

## How Bris works

### Model architecture

Bris follows an encoder-processor-decoder structure common in recent data-driven weather models {% cite bi2023 bonev2025 lam2023 lang2024a %}.

- **Encoder:** Transforms input atmospheric fields into a latent representation.
- **Processor:** Exchanges information across variables and spatial locations within the latent space.
- **Decoder:** Maps the latent state back to physical space to produce forecasts.

### Graph neural network (GNN)

The model operates on a graph where nodes represent spatial locations and edges connect neighboring points. Crucially, the model’s computations are performed on the edges, capturing interactions between locations.

(b) The encoder-processor-decoder architecture injects noise (z) into the latent space to model stochasticity. (c) Predictions are evaluated using point-wise and spectral loss functions.*

### Training objective

Bris is trained probabilistically using the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), which encourages accurate and sharp probabilistic forecasts.

To ensure spatial coherence and realistic patterns, the training objective includes spectral components evaluated via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This combination helps the model produce physically consistent and sharp fields.

## Comparison with MEPS and operational outlook

Bris achieves comparable forecast skill to MEPS, the operational high-resolution ensemble prediction system, while running significantly faster. This speed-up opens possibilities for rapid forecasting and ensemble generation on limited computational resources.

We are actively working to integrate Bris into operational workflows to complement existing NWP systems.

## Conclusions

The WeatherGenerator project aims to develop next-generation weather forecasting models that combine high resolution, probabilistic outputs, and computational efficiency. This is vital for improving warnings of increasingly frequent extreme weather events and maintaining Europe’s leadership in global weather prediction.

Europe’s rich meteorological datasets and high-performance computing infrastructure provide a strong foundation for achieving these goals.
