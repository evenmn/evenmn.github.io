Computer experiments provide offer information that is not available in real experiments, at the same time as they are less error prone and often cheaper. This is why ever more research is based on computer simulations. However, can we really rely on computer simulations when making important decision? How do we know that the computer experiments capture effects as the real experiments? The answer is that the simulations has to be tested and verified on the exact thing that we aim to investigate, as computer simulations will never capture all aspects of the real world. 

This blog post will be about computer simulations of water: A highly important, yet highly complex substance to model. When looking at real systems, it is hard to ignore water. Water is the most common liquid on Earth, and is found in most geological, biological and (fill in) environments. At the same time, water features some really strange features like (fill in). making it difficult to model. 

To overcome these challenges, the most common water models are rigid, meaning that the distance between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms are kept fixed. This discards/supresses all the reactions, acidity and many other chemical processes that are crusial to realistically model a real system.
