Measuring the frictional coefficient between two surfaces is a trivial task, and has been performed for many centuries. Given the surface's topology, the frictional coefficient can be found by experiments or simulations.

The inverse operation where a surface ... We call this inverse frictional design. Existing inverse design algorithms are computationally intensive, and require significant insights about the physics of the problem. Here, we propose a machine learning approach based on a conditional diffusion model where surfaces are skillfully generated for given friction coefficient.

To be continued.
