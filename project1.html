        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my webpage! My name is Even Marius Nordhagen, and I'm a computational physicist. One of today's biggest challenges is climate ... Friction accounts for 25\% of the annual energy consumption \cite{holmberg}. This includes friction in engines, ... The underlying mechanics behind friction are still not understood \cite{...}. A general way to predict the friction based on material constants is missing, and we still do not have a general way to reduce the friction, not even by 1\% \cite{krylov}. There are several approaches to attack this problem, including analytical, experimental and computational methods. My work focuses on computations,

        - Simulations offer higher resolution in space and time compared to experiments
        - Reduce change of external factors that are not relevant to affect the results
        - Individual particles can be tracked

I also work on the intercept between physics and machine learning. In fact, many of the popular machine learning methods are heavily inspired by physics. One example is the diffusion model, which is based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics \cite{dickstein}. Another example is the flow model, inspired by fluid dynamics \cite{...}. The Boltzmann machine, which has been used to solve the Ising model \cite{carleo2015}, is inspired by statistical physics. Several of these methods are applied and investigated in my projects. 

On this webpage I will publish selected projects that I have been working on, either alone or in collaboration with others. </p>
