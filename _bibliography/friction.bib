	abstract = {The program of this investigation on sliding friction is concerned with the evaluation of the frictional forces which occur under very high contact pressures and under varying conditions of speed, temperature, and lubrication. The work presented herein covers the experiments which have been made on sliding friction at normal temperatures. Further experiments on boundary lubrication at normal temperatures and sliding friction at elevated temperatures will be reported in a second paper.This report indicates the behavior of sliding friction when large normal loads react between surfaces in contact over a wide range of sliding velocities. At velocities less than one inch per second magnified photographs of the ruptured surfaces indicate clearly this phenomenon of stick-slip. From the experimental records obtained it was possible to show that a functional relation exists between the following variables: (1) The sliding velocity, (2) the normal load, and, (3) the frequency of stick-slip. New experimental evidence is presented indicating that the natural frequency of the apparatus involved influences the phenomenon of stick-slip.},

	abstract = {Changes in fault normal stress can either inhibit or promote rupture propagation, depending on the fault geometry and on how fault shear strength varies in response to the normal stress change. A better understanding of this dependence will lead to improved earthquake simulation techniques, and ultimately, improved earthquake hazard mitigation efforts. We present the results of new laboratory experiments investigating the effects of step changes in fault normal stress on the fault shear strength during sliding, using bare Westerly granite samples, with roughened sliding surfaces, in a double direct shear apparatus. Previous experimental studies examining the shear strength following a step change in the normal stress produce contradictory results: a set of double direct shear experiments indicates that the shear strength of a fault responds immediately, and then is followed by a prolonged slip-dependent response, while a set of shock loading experiments indicates that there is no immediate component, and the response is purely gradual and slip-dependent. In our new, high-resolution experiments, we observe that the acoustic transmissivity and dilatancy of simulated faults in our tests respond immediately to changes in the normal stress, consistent with the interpretations of previous investigations, and verify an immediate increase in the area of contact between the roughened sliding surfaces as normal stress increases. However, the shear strength of the fault does not immediately increase, indicating that the new area of contact between the rough fault surfaces does not appear preloaded with any shear resistance or strength. Additional slip is required for the fault to achieve a new shear strength appropriate for its new loading conditions, consistent with previous observations made during shock loading.},

	abstract = {This study is to determine the detailed response of shear strength and other fault properties to changes in normal stress at room temperature using dry initially bare rock surfaces of granite at normal stresses between 5 and 7 MPa. Rapid normal stress changes result in gradual, approximately exponential changes in shear resistance with fault slip. The characteristic length of the exponential change is similar for both increases and decreases in normal stress. In contrast, changes in fault normal displacement and the amplitude of small high-frequency elastic waves transmitted across the surface follow a two stage response consisting of a large immediate and a smaller gradual response with slip. The characteristic slip distance of the small gradual response is significantly smaller than that of shear resistance. The stability of sliding in response to large step decreases in normal stress is well predicted using the shear resistance slip length observed in step increases. Analysis of the shear resistance and slip-time histories suggest nearly immediate changes in strength occur in response to rapid changes in normal stress; these are manifested as an immediate change in slip speed. These changes in slip speed can be qualitatively accounted for using a rate-independent strength model. Collectively, the observations and model show that acceleration or deceleration in response to normal stress change depends on the size of the change, the frictional characteristics of the fault surface, and the elastic properties of the loading system.},

	abstract = {Friction is the force resisting relative motion of objects. The force depends on material properties, loading conditions and external factors such as temperature and humidity, but also contact aging has been identified as a primary factor. Several aging mechanisms have been proposed, including increased “contact quantity” due to plastic or elastic creep and enhanced “contact quality” due to formation of strong interfacial bonds. However, comparatively less attention has been given to other mechanisms that enhance the “contact quantity”. In this study, we explore the influence of crystal faceting on the augmentation of “contact quantity” in cubic silicon carbide, driven by the minimization of surface free energy. Our observations reveal that the temporal evolution of the frictional aging effect follows a logarithmic pattern, akin to several other aging mechanisms. However, this particular mechanism is driven by internal capillary forces instead of the normal force typically associated with friction. Due to this fundamental distinction, existing frictional aging models fail to comprehensively explain the observed behavior. In light of these findings, we derive a model for the evolution of contact area caused by diffusion-driven frictional aging, drawing upon principles from statistical mechanics. Upon application of a normal force, the friction force is increased due to plastic creep. This investigation presents an alternative explanation for the logarithmic aging behavior observed and offers the potential to contribute to the development of more accurate friction models.},
