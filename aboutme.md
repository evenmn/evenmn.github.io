Hi! I'm Even, a physicist by profesion, but currently working on weather modeling using data-driven models at the [Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway)](https://met.no/en). I have a keen interest in physics in general, modeling, visualization and machine learning, and find myself often solving problems with code. Do not hesitate reaching out to me if you ever want to discuss the aformentioned topics.

In my spare time I enjoy being active and social, spending time on CrossFit, gravel cycling and playing chess (I'm the ultimate freak in other words).

*Even (pronounced /ˈɛvən/), which translates to "happy victor," is a traditional Norwegian name with origins in Old Norse. Satellite images that looks like letters.

## My background
I grew up in the small village of Auli in the meteropolean area of Oslo, Norway, and moved to Oslo to study physics at the University of Oslo (UiO) in 2014. I obtained my bachelor degree in 2017, where I spent an exchange semester at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.

For my master's degree I studied how to solve the Schrodinger equation using machine learning. In quantum mechanics, the variational principle tells us that any wave function that yields solution to the Schrodinger equation will give a local energy larger or equal (in the case of the ground state) to the ground state energy. Thus, a trial wave function with variational parameters may be optimized with respect to minimizing the local energy in order to find the ground state of a quantum system. This is a natural machine learning problem, as the wave function naturally can be represented by a neural network and the local energy is a natural cost function that we want to minimize. The master thesis ended up in [a publication](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphy.2023.1061580).

Alongside my studies, I got the opportunety to have the perfect part time job as a teaching assistent at UiO. I taught various courses at the department of physics, including classical mechanics, electromagnetism and computational physics (see complete list below). I got a summer internship at Andøya Space Center (ASC) in the summer of 2018, where my job was to develop an automatized framework for detect clouds. To be able to launch rockets, the atmospheric winds have to be evaluated using LIDARs, which only works when the sky is clear. The cloud coverage was back then estimated manually, which was both inaccurate and error-prone. By using an all-sky camera, we managed to make software for automatic detection of clouds. As a side note, ASC just became [the first site in Europe to launch satellites](https://andoyaspace.no/news-articles/andoya-spaceport-officially-opened/)!

After my masters, I embarked on a PhD degree where I measured friction on the nanoscale using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. MD simulations offer resolution in space and time superior to what is possible in real experiments, and thus provide information that else is unavailable. I observed that frictional silicon carbide interfaces strengthen with time due to surface diffusion, which explains how sliding friction decreases with larger sliding velocities ([E. M. Nordhagen, H. A. Sveinsson, A. M. Sørenssen, "Diffusion-driven Frictional Aging in Silicon Carbide", *Tribology letters* **71**, 95 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11249-023-01762-z)). I also got very interested in generative machine learning modeling, and based on that I found a way to solve the inverse friction design problem. I defended my PhD in August 2024. 

In May 2024, I started in a research position at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway) with the goal of developing a machine learning model for accurate regional weather prediction over the Nordics. Machine learning models in global weather forecasting has recently gained massive attention due to their accuracy and relatively low computational cost. We aim to build on this work, making a regional counterpart (preprint available: [arXiv:2409.02891](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02891)).

I have observed that, throughout my brief academic career, I have progressively modeled increasingly larger systems. Beginning with single atoms, I advanced to nanoscale systems containing thousands to millions of atoms, and then to weather systems, which operate on a vastly different scale. Perhaps the next step is cosmological modeling?
